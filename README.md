# VS Code Helion Theme

This is a mid-contrast dark theme for Visual Studio Code loosely based on [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) and an old listomania image for "colors that faded away," featuring pigments created from materials either no longer available or no longer in use due to various factors.

* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
